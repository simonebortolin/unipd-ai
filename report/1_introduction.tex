This topic has been devised mainly because of two nowadays problems. First, as described by \citet{olbergml}, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement. Second, the increasing number of terrorist attacks have forced main companies in the emergency lighting sector to produce dynamic lamps to indicate which is the most suitable emergency exit and not only the nearest one.

Moreover, in the last period, due to the increase of natural catastrophes and to the war in Ukraine it becomes even more necessary to have matching models that manage automatically  these kinds of problems. At first sight they might seem unrelated to each other but in reality they are extremely tied and similar.
