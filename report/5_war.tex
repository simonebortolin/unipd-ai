\subsubsection{Use of matching models in case of war}\label{use-of-matching-model-in-case-of-war}%
    The previous models, as well guessed
    are very important in case of war: the first model is used just
    to redistribute in a fair way people in case of mass escapes, the second one to optimize the evacuation
    towards bunkers or other safe places in case of attacks and attempts to buildings.
    The second model can be widely used to manage the evacuation and moving to safe locations of buildings, hospitals,
    entire campuses, cities and counties.
    In~\citet{delacretaz_2020,delacretaz_2019,delacretaz_2016}   there are other example cases of use of this models.
    
    
\subsubsection{Similarities and differences between mechanisms}\label{similarities-and-differences-between-mechanisms}

    As we have seen the two previous models are very similar, there are few differences and it is possible to use a
    common system for the analysis and to realize the matching for both cases.
    in fact in~\citet{delacretaz_2020} the model has been generalized to be adepted in more situations.
