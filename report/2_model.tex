\subsection{Matching model under preferences}\label{matching-model-under-preferences}%

Matching under preferences is a tool from cooperative game theory. It can be applied to two-sided
markets in which heterogeneous agents, or goods, of one side are to be distributed over agents or
goods of the other side of the market, and the satisfaction of agents’ preferences, or respect for agents’
priorities, matter. Gale and Shapley laid the theoretical foundations for the theory.
Matching markets with sizes arise in a variety of contexts and in its simplest model, agents have ordinal preferences over objects that are available in multiple identical units. For each object, agents
are ranked according to exogenous priorities. Agents can have a size of either one or two:
single-unit agents require one unit of an object and double-unit agents require two units of the
same object. The model can be extended in various ways to fit specific applications in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item constraints may take place over several dimensions
    \item agents may have preferences over both an object and a number of
    units
    \item agents may desire units of different objects
\end{itemize}
An agent and an object form a blocking pair of a
given matching if the agent prefers the object to his own and at least the number of units he requires are either unassigned or assigned to agents with a lower priority.
Stability, initially introduced by Gale and Shapley in 1962, is a central concept in matching theory. A matching
is stable if it does not have any blocking pair. In two-sided matching markets, with
strategic agents on both sides, stability constitutes an essential equilibrium criterion, thus an unstable matching is not at equilibrium. A blocking pair
is unfair in the sense that the agent is not able to get an object even though he has a high enough priority.
