    ABSTRACT = {It has been suggested that the distribution of refugees over host countries can be made more fair or efficient if policy makers take into account not only numbers of refugees to be distributed but also the goodness of the matches between refugees and their possible host countries. There are different ways to design distribution mechanisms that incorporate this practice, which opens up a space for normative considerations. In particular, if the mechanism takes countries’ or refugees’ preferences into account, there may be trade-offs between satisfying their preferences and the number of refugees distributed. This article argues that, in such cases, it is not a reasonable policy to satisfy preferences. Moreover, conditions are given which, if satisfied, prevent the trade-off from occurring. Finally, it is argued that countries should not express preferences over refugees, but rather that priorities for refugees should be imposed, and that fairness beats efficiency in the context of distributing asylum. The framework of matching theory is used to make the arguments precise, but the results are general and relevant for other distribution mechanisms such as the relocations currently in effect in the European Union.},

    title = {Enabling Trade-offs in Machine Learning-based Matching for Refugee Resettlement},

    ABSTRACT = {The Swiss State Secretariat for Migration recently announced a pilot project for a machine learning-based assignment process for refugee resettlement. This approach has the potential to substantially increase the overall employment rate of refugees in Switzerland. However, the currently proposed method ignores families' preferences. In this paper, we build on this prior work and propose two matching mechanisms that additionally take families' preferences over locations into account. The first mechanism is strategyproof while the second is not but achieves higher family welfare. Importantly, we parameterize both mechanisms, giving placement officers precise control how to trade off family welfare against overall employment success. Preliminary simulations on synthetic data show that both mechanisms can significantly increase family welfare even with only a small loss on the overall employment rate of refugees..},

    abstract = {Tens of thousands of refugees are permanently resettled from refugee camps to hosting countries every year. In the past, placement of refugees was essentially ad hoc, but more recently resettlement agencies have been trying to place refugees systematically in order to improve their outcomes. Yet, even at present, refugee resettlement processes account for neither the priorities of hosting communities nor the preferences of refugees themselves. Building on models from two-sided matching theory, we introduce a new framework for matching with multidimensional constraints that models refugee families’ needs for multiple units of different services, as well as the service capacities of localities. We propose four refugee resettlement mechanisms and two solution concepts that can be used in refugee resettlement matching under various institutional and informational constraints. Our mechanisms can improve match efficiency, respect priorities of localities, and incentivize refugees to report where they would prefer to settle.},

    abstract = {Matching markets such as day care, student exchange, refugee resettlement, and
couples problems involve agents of different sizes, that is agents who require different
amounts of capacity. I study a matching market between agents and objects where the
size of an agent is either one or two. Contrary to canonical models, the set of stable
matchings may be empty. I identify a trade-off for existence: it is always possible to
either bound the instability to a certain number of units per object or to eliminate
waste but the existence of a matching that does both is not guaranteed. I develop
two fairness criteria that lie on either side of this trade-off: unit-stability bounds the
instability and size-stability eliminates waste. I show that size-stability is more desirable
than unit-stability from a welfare point of view.},

Our mechanisms can improve match efficiency, incentivize refugees to report where

to accept more refugees overall. Beyond the refugee resettlement context, our model
has applications ranging from the allocation of daycare slots to the incorporation of
complex diversity constraints in public school assignment.},

    abstract = {Asylum seekers are often assigned to a locality in their host country directly upon arrival based on some type of uninformed dynamic matching system which does not take the background of the asylum seekers into consideration. This paper proposes an informed, intuitive, easy-to-implement and computationally efficient dynamic mechanism for matching asylum seekers to localities. This mechanism can be adopted in any dynamic refugee matching problem given locality-specific quotas and that asylum seekers can be classified into specific types. We demonstrate that any matching selected by the proposed mechanism is Pareto efficient and that envy between localities is bounded by a single asylum seeker. Via simulation, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in settings that resemble the US and the Swedish situations, and show that our mechanism outperforms uninformed mechanisms even in presence of severe misclassification error in the estimation of asylum seeker types.},

    abstract={The member states of the European Union received 1.2 million first time asylum applications in 2015 (a doubling compared to 2014). Even if asylum will be granted for many of the refugees that made the journey to Europe, several obstacles for successful integration remain. This paper focuses on one of these obstacles, namely the problem of finding housing for refugees once they have been granted asylum. In particular, the focus is restricted to the situation in Sweden during 2015–2016 and it is demonstrated that market design can play an important role in a partial solution to the problem. More specifically, because almost all accommodation options are exhausted in Sweden, the paper investigates a matching system, closely related to the system adopted by the European NGO \&quot;Refugees Welcome\&quot;, and proposes an easy-to-implement mechanism that finds an efficient stable maximum matching. Such matching guarantees that housing is efficiently provided to a maximum number of refugees and that no refugee prefers some landlord to their current match when, at the same time, that specific landlord prefers that refugee to his current match.},

    abstract = {International migration is maybe the single most effective way to alleviate global poverty. When a given host country allows more immigrants in, this creates costs and benefits for that particular country as well as a positive externality for individuals and governments who care about world poverty. Host countries quite often restrict immigration due to its important social and political costs, however these costs are never measured and made comparable across countries. In this paper we first show theoretically that tradable immigration quotas (TIQs) can reveal countries' comparative advantages in hosting immigrants and — once coupled with a matching mechanism taking migrants' preferences over destinations and countries' preferences over migrants' types into account — allow for exploiting them efficiently. We then discuss three potential applications: a market for the resettlement of international refugees, a market for the resettlement of migrants displaced by climate change, and the creation of an OECD poverty-reduction visa program adapted from the US green card lottery.}
